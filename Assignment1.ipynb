    "3. Are genes on/off are are there more subpopulation in the \"on\" state\"? \n",

    "4. Do genes in this panel have similar expression level? How would you look at it? \n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the gene expression profile for the different cell types? What type of viz would be best to see that? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How well can you identify cell types if you approximate gene expression to on/off \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Are there genes with similar expression pattern? How would you look at it? \n",
    "\n",
    "8. For different cell types, how similar are cells to in other in that type (similar = correlated expression)\n",
