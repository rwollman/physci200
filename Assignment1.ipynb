    "5. What is the gene expression profile for the different cell types? What type of viz would be best to see that? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. How well can you identify cell types if you approximate gene expression to on/off \n",

    "8. For different cell types, how similar are cells to in other in that type (similar = correlated expression)\n",
