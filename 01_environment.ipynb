    "## Environments and Kernels in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter notebooks, a **kernel** is a computational engine that executes the code contained in your notebook. When you run a code cell, that code is executed within the kernel and any output is returned back to the cell to be displayed. The kernel maintains the state of a notebook's computations, which means you can think of it as a \"live\" version of your notebook's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have kernels for different programming languages, each of which can be used to execute code in a different language. For example, if you're working in a Python 3 notebook, your kernel is a Python 3 kernel and all of your code is executed as Python 3 code.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **environment** in a Jupyter notebook is a context in which your notebook runs. This context includes the kernel, a set of libraries and modules, and the settings for the notebook. When you create a new notebook, you can choose which environment (and therefore, which kernel and libraries) you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can manage your environments with conda or virtualenv to create isolated spaces for your projects, which can have their own specific versions of Python and installed packages. This can be useful if different projects require different versions of Python or different libraries."

    "\n",
    "The kernel maintains the state of a notebook's computations. This means it keeps track of the variables and their values, loaded modules, defined functions, and more. When you restart the kernel, you're essentially resetting this computational environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what happens when you restart a kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **All variables and functions defined in the notebook are lost**: Since the kernel maintains the state of the notebook's computations, when it's restarted, all Python objects defined in the previous session are lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The notebook's output remains, but it's no longer connected to the code**: After a kernel restart, the output from cells run in the previous session still appears in the notebook, but it's no longer connected to the code. This means that if you had a cell that displayed the value of a variable, after a kernel restart, the value will still be displayed, but the variable itself will no longer be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **You start with a clean slate**: After a kernel restart, you're starting with a fresh Python environment. This is equivalent to restarting Python itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restarting the kernel can be useful in various situations. For example, if your code is stuck in an infinite loop, or if it's using up too much memory or CPU and you need to stop it, you can restart the kernel to stop the computations. It's also useful when you want to ensure that your code runs correctly from start to finish without relying on any previous computations or variables."
